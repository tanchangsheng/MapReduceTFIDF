excellent small thin i thought bad  i ordered shipped my then took off 3400 mile trip  because my other gps units other other family members already other i bought one budget optimistic was new  before i hated all criticms other reviews came back haunt i tell you aboutplease note few positive reviews you noticed they mostly all people who no experience gps they spend much time before they reviewed  they experience gps 4 like century terms how fast technologypositive if their first gps if they comparing car navigational gps 4 years then quite bit compared new units like mio 310x tom tom one which i then viamichelin user horrible use tomtom often finish what you typing they intuitive programmers polished viamichelin very non absolutely dangerous try use  we not supposed use them while we one truly dangerous even when you learn complicated  so most you pull over work  no even you program if you go another screen you program history all  you soon frustrated how many steps unit takes how often i try give you small form decent sirf 3 navteq four hour battery  good price chip horrible non intuitive software multi step interface make your life horrible if you rush even if you not  horrible so poor speaker so you hear road noise speaker all way while crackle  i read honestly believe i owned  unlike gps one literally tells you before tell you which way when routed nearest  think about  means sometimes you chance making right choice which way if you guess tells you turn around go other  one feature should enough make you say most gps least tell you where you parked one say without seem route you drive onto  parking  already satellite not software bugaboo i think built  makes you because find your location know which way you you start routes direction you  bad software design  when you go you installed another sd canadian inconvenient when you cross  navteq maps not find many locations coastal we driving coastal roads said not  i found very slow recalculating trips when you missed turn slower than my  mio 310 which was purchasd last tom tom one which was purchased recalculation problem busy city caused us miss several critical  want find  forget too many steps illogical organization compared other major often not find even local 20   i parked front walmarts not old  tomtom mio not list all least they get 4 5 out 7 my home  not so  several towns maine i parked front rows old stores  punch  local stores difficult use poi find  punch look stores like nearest tom tom no problems finding nearest ones knew about your  within certain distance not show  then figure out next town search try find  very tell you how much trouble  so simple other you get spoiled garmin  one makes so hard still find  no gps finds all limit  seems via programmers spent their time gathering addresses bank not believe once used organized make you believe programmers never actually used gps themselvesi say enough about how interface when you go another often loses where you start all over again programming where you going through multiple difficult  when you lose you start all when i bought i read some negative positive reviews bad  i thought complaining people probably not techie complaining no   experienced gps users ones know just how clunky bad software interface compared sleek garmin tom tom  one my daughter began throw we find emergency medical treatment clunky interface made very difficult locate when you you want quickly find nearest  unit makes you put if you further than x miles when you you literally guessing which town search find  which  i happen before about 3 clicks bam you searched found nearest more click you routed nearesti sad not recommend  i really recommend you like some other reviewers i recommend you buy more easy use mio great blazing fast sirf 3 calculating  if you tech buy garmin their awesome easy use softwarebuy bad horrible poorly buggy  looks like killer unpolished clunky paper tiger horrible tomtom one  mio fast pleasure  even newer fun their simplicity hated screen some old  viamichelin no fun programmed not pleasure although take you  believe pleasure low price quickly fade once you start working unhearable interface poorly organized features disorganized polished quick intuitive menu where garmin tomtom  only thing better viamichellin screen older use older satellite gps chip than new via use same gps satellite faster software routines cpu  even use chip via cannot make poor software menu thing should blazing much slower than my tomtom  only thing better unit than via smaller maybe navteq maps might slightly better some  other than mio wins hands far better easier use gps my  if you looking software go garmin then then via  if you looking value great unit then go mio killer unit  if you looking simplicity i programming where you go garmin then i tried you you need go like other gps  you just too unfinished rough

self contradictory evaluations performance services vs manufacturing common always falls down side manufacturing industry far far better than service industry even when all standard economic indicators suggest challenge reader seems you going your lyinghe rips american post industrial industries labor intensive vulnerable low wage nations because americans no smarter more creative more

assertions always modified his subjective opinion never put when describing service industries million revenues foreign sources when describing manufacturing very million good similar glowing assessments inevitable despite number number itself means fact author leaves out head direct comparison between industriesofficial figures ultimate source information when they agree what author when
